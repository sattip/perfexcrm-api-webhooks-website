# Stripe Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
The PerfexCRM API & Webhooks module now includes a fully automated Stripe payment integration with an admin dashboard for managing sales.

## Quick Start

### 1. Admin Setup
First time setup requires creating an admin account:

1. Navigate to `/admin-setup`
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click "Create Admin Account"

### 2. Connect Stripe Account

After logging in to the admin dashboard:

1. Click the **"Connect Stripe"** button in the yellow banner
2. You'll see a modal with instructions
3. Get your API keys from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
4. Enter your **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
5. Enter your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)
6. Click **"Connect Stripe"**

**Important:** Start with test keys to ensure everything works before going live!

### 3. Create Products

Once Stripe is connected:

1. Go to the **"Stripe Setup"** tab
2. Click **"Create Products"** button
3. This automatically creates:
   - Regular License ($89) - Single domain, 6 months support
   - Extended License ($449) - Unlimited domains, 12 months priority support

### 4. Start Accepting Payments

Your website is now ready to accept payments! Customers can:

1. Visit your website
2. Click "Buy Now" on any pricing plan
3. Complete checkout through Stripe
4. Automatically receive their license key via email

## Admin Dashboard Features

## Testing the Integration

### Using the Test Script
```bash
node test-stripe-flow.js
```

This script will:
1. Verify admin authentication
2. Check Stripe connection
3. Ensure products are created
4. Test checkout flow

### Manual Testing

1. Use Stripe test cards:
   - Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Decline: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - More test cards: https://stripe.com/docs/testing

2. Create a test purchase:
   - Go to your website's pricing section
   - Click "Buy Now"
   - Use a test card
   - Check the admin dashboard for the sale

## Switching to Live Mode

When ready for production:

1. Get your live API keys from Stripe
2. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Stripe Setup
3. Click "Disconnect" (if test keys are connected)
4. Click "Connect Stripe" again
5. Enter your **live** API keys
6. Re-create products with live pricing

## Webhook Configuration

Webhooks are automatically configured when you connect Stripe. They handle:
- Payment confirmations
- License key delivery
- Failed payment notifications
- Refund processing

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored securely in the database
- Secret keys are never exposed to the frontend
- All payment processing happens server-side
- Session tokens expire after 7 days
- HTTPS is required for production

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Stripe keys" error
- Ensure keys are copied correctly without spaces
- Verify you're using the correct mode (test vs live)
- Check Stripe dashboard for API key access

### Products not showing
- Click "Create Products" in Stripe Setup tab
- Ensure Stripe account is fully activated
- Check for any Stripe account restrictions

### Checkout not working
- Verify Stripe is connected (check admin dashboard)
- Ensure products are created
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify your domain is added to Stripe

### Sales not appearing
- Check webhook logs in Stripe dashboard
- Ensure webhook endpoint is accessible
- Verify webhook secret is configured

## Support

For additional help:
- Check Stripe documentation: https://stripe.com/docs
- Review webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard
- Check application logs for errors
- Contact support with your admin dashboard URL

## API Reference

### Key Endpoints

- `POST /api/admin/stripe/setup` - Connect Stripe account
- `POST /api/admin/stripe/products` - Create products

## Environment Variables

While the system now uses database configuration, you can still set fallback values:

```env
# Fallback Stripe configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Application settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## License Key Format

License keys are automatically generated in the format:
```
PFX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
```

Each key is unique and tied to a specific purchase and customer email.
