## üéØ How It Works

### Customer Purchase Flow
1. Customer completes Stripe payment
2. System generates unique license key
3. Creates sale record with license details
4. Sends email with license key and members area access

### Members Area Access
1. Customer visits `/members`
2. Enters license key and email address
3. System verifies credentials against sale records
4. Shows dashboard with license info and download options

### File Download Process
1. Customer clicks download button
2. System validates license and checks download limits
3. Generates secure download token (1-hour expiry)
4. Provides direct download link
5. Logs download activity and updates counters

### License Validation (For Module)
1. Module makes API call to `/api/license/validate`
2. Provides license key and domain
3. System checks license type and domain restrictions
4. Creates/updates license activation record
5. Returns validation status and license details

```

### File Permissions
```bash
chmod 644 downloads/*.zip
chmod 755 downloads/
